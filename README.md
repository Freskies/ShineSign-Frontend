# ShineSing

ShineSign is a webapp designed to help
amateur sports associations (a.s.d. in italy)
to manage the paperwork of their activities.

It's common for a.s.d. to not have a own place,
and to use a shared place (like a gym) to host their activities.
In those cases, the paperwork is usually managed by the
single person that is in charge of the activity.
ShineSign is designed to help that person, removing the need
of real paper documents and creating a central place to, create,
share and sign documents.
